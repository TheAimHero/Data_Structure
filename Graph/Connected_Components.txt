Connected Components
  A graph can contain many nodes which are not connected to every other node in
  the graph. This does not mean that these nodes are not the part of the graph.
  Therefore we have to make sure to traverse the entire graph. For this purpose
  we use a visited array. The visited array contain a log of the nodes which has
  been visited.
